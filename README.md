Flare (Federated Learning AcceleRation Engine) is a distributed machine learning system for Federated Learning. We build Flare based on FATE and deploy it using Docker. Flare provides a high-performance distributed FL computation model and a friendly programming model. The main technologies include dynamic dataflow execution, heterogeneous secret computing accelerator and inter-party communication scheduler.
